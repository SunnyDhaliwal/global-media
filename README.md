Global Media technical test

The steps outlined were as follows: 

1. Open site https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/
2. Add to cart 4 - Gwyn Endurance Tee Medium Green
3. Address should United Kingdom
4. Check cart total is $92.00 (discount applied)
5. Update the Quantity of  Gwyn Endurance Tee Medium Green to 3
6. Add to cart 1 - Gwyn Endurance Tee Small Yellow
7. Add to cart 1 Quest Lumaflexâ„¢ Band
8. Check cart total is $116.00

Some points that were noted: 

- Discount is only applied at the last stage of the checkout
- Shipping is manditorily charged for a UK address however this is out of scope for the test
- A cart total of $115.00 was acheived however the brief stated $116.00 I couldnt get to this number
- I added a couple of reusable commands to the commands.js file in order to clean up the test

The test is written in cypress so may require installation before running. There is a video in the Cypress/videos folder that shows the full test running

Thnak you for the oppurtunity to take this test, I enjoyed this task!
